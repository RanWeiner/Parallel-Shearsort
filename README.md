# Parallel-Shearsort
Shearsort Algorithm implementation using MPI, to sort a set of words in lexicographic order

•	At the end of the program the words are displayed in a snake-like matrix order.

•	Using odd-even sort algorithm.

•	N^2 process to N^2 words, matrix NxN.

•	Assume that N is even.

•	The input file is organized as following:

Number of words

Word1

Word2

…

WordN
